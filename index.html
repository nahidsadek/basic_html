                  <h2>Hilsa Fish (‡¶á‡¶≤‡¶ø‡¶∂ ‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶õ)</h2>
                  <hr />
                    
                    <p> The most famous <b> Hilsha Fish </b> comes from <strong> Chandpur, Bangladesh.</strong> The fish contributes about 12% of the total fish production and about 1.15% of GDP in Bangladesh. On 6 August 2017, Department of Patents, Designs and Trademarks under the Ministry of Industries of Bangladesh has declared the recognition of ilish as the product of Bangladesh.  <br> </p>

                    <p> Hilsa fish is considered to be one of most favorite and <strong> delicious fish in the world.</strong> It is the most popular fish to the Bengalis who call it as Ilish. It is found in Indian sub-continent especially in Bangladesh. It is the national fish of Bangladesh. <br> </p>

                    <p> The most amazing fact about hilsa is that it is a sea fish but lay eggs in the large river      especially in <strong> Padma-Meghna-Jamuna</strong> delta at Bay of Bengal. <br> </p>

                    <p>
                    <b> Physical Profile of Hilsa Fish: </b> The body of hilsa is very dense and fairly deep with dorsal and ventral profile equally curved. It equally spread medium-sized scales give a metallic silver shine. Usually it's length may vary from 40 cm to 60 cm. A large-sized hilsa weighs about 1.2 to 2.5 kg. <strong> Female hilsa are usually larger than males. </strong> The hilsa is known to be a fast swimmer and can cover even 60 kilometers at a time. It attains maturity in 1 to 2 years. </p>

                    <p> <b> Hilsa as Food: </b> Hilsa is an oily fish and rich in essential omega 3 fatty acids. A recent experiment has shown it has beneficial effects in decreasing cholesterol level and insulin level. </p>

                    <p> In Bangladesh this fish is prepared in a lot number of varieties - people say in more than 50 different ways. It can be smoked, fried, steamed, baked, prepared with mustard seed paste, curd, brinjal (eggplant).  Some common hilsa menus are <strong> Fried hilsa, Khichuri-Ilish, Sorshe Ilish, Panta Ilish etc. </strong> It takes a very little oil to cook hilsa as the fish itself is very oily. In North America and UK (where the fish is not always availavle) hilsa-dishes are found especially in Bengali cuisine. </p>

                        <p> <b> Hilsa in culture: </b> Hilsa is one most important fish in the world in terms of cultural importance. It is an obvious food in a good number of festivities in Bangladesh and India. Most of the Hingu Bengali families buy two Hilsa fishes (known as Joda Ilish) in auspicious days, like some Saraswati Puja. The custom mainly prevail Hindu Bengalis from former East Bengal (Bangladesh) in West Bengal, Assam, Tripura in India. In the dawn of Pahela Baisaksh (Bengali New Year) people of Bangladesh and West Bengal of India <strong> welcomes the new year with Panta-Ilish (wet rice, and Hilsa fish). </strong></p>

                  <h2>Rice (‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶§)</h2>
                  <hr />
                    
                  <p> Food prepared by boiling rice or rice in water. Rice is the staple food of the people of Bangladesh and West Bengal in India. There is also a trend of eating rice in the Indian subcontinent. In addition to the Indian subcontinent, rice consumption is prevalent in China, Japan and Korea. However, different types of rice are eaten in different ways depending on the place. West Bengal and Bangladesh eat neat rice. But in China, Japan and Korea, eating glutinous rice is popular. </p>

                  <p> Different types of fragrant rice are cooked based on different varieties of rice. About 65 types of rice are mentioned in Mansamangal Kavya. The mention of rice in Bengali cuisine can be traced back to ancient and medieval times. Also in Bengali conversation the word rice is mentioned in various proverbs. </p>
                  
                  <p> Apart from just eating, rice is also used to prepare different types of food. Among them Polanna (Polao), Biryani, Fried Rice are popular and noted. </p>
                  
                  <p> <b>Nutritious</b> </p>
                  <p> Rice mainly provides carbohydrates. But some meat is also found in it. Sugar 79%, fat 6%, some meat, vitamins and mineral salts.</p>
                  
                  <p> If the starch or foam is removed after cooking the rice, the starch content of the rice is greatly reduced. As a result, there is less chance of getting fat even after eating a lot of rice. Such misconceptions have been around for a long time. In recent years, several studies including the research report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the <strong> United Nations </strong> (FAO) have proved that if the rice starch is thrown away, 18 types of nutrients including starch and sugar are wasted which exist in sitting rice. And these nutrients greatly reduce the harmful effects of sugar. <strong> Science researcher Gazi Rafiq </strong> has shown in a study conducted from 2010 to 2012, the rate of rice wastage is 13-15 percent due to rice cooking in starching method. 42-51 lakh tons of rice is being wasted. <br> <br>
                     The financial value of which stands at 16800-20400 crore per annum (at an average rate of 40 taka per kg). If this method of cooking is made popular in the region by creating public awareness, <strong> it will be possible to prevent the wastage of 42-51 lakh tons of rice by saving 13-15% of the total population's demand</strong> , besides eliminating nutritional deficiency. Along with this, import dependence will also decrease. </p>
                  
                  <p><b> Fen </b></p>
                  <p> During the boiling of rice, many of the rice grains burst and the starch inside them dissolves in the water. The aqueous portion of this starch mixture is called fen or fen. During the various famines of Bengal in the sixties, begging rice fen was the only means of subsistence for many poor people. </p> 
                  
                  <p> <strong>Starch</strong> </p>
                  <p> If rice is boiled in too much water for too long, most of the rice melts into the foam, creating a very thick starch solution (extension). It is called starch. Before ironing, the cloth is soaked in flour and dried to stiffen it. This is called starching. </p>
